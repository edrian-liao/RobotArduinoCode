# RobotArduinoCode
The code implements functions that lets the BOE-bot perform the following: (1) line-following using QTI sensors, (2) detecting presence of mirror using a QTI sensor, (3) detecting the color using a ColorPAL senor, (4) transmits signals to and from other BOE-bots using the XBee Communications Module, etc.
